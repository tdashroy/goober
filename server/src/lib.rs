//! Goober backend.
//!
//! Scope so far: create a group (creator = admin), join a group with name +
//! phone (re-attach by phone), bearer-token auth on every authenticated request,
//! the group's curated places, requesting a ride as a direct ping to a set of
//! members, the group-visible feed of those rides, and the ride lifecycle the
//! people pinged drive — answering the ping, claiming the ride, arriving,
//! delivering — with every step audited. SSE, push and points come later.
//!
//! The app is built by [`build_app`] from a [`SqlitePool`], so tests can drive
//! the exact same router against a throwaway database without a live server.
